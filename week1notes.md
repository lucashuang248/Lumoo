## 5.4 Crowdsourcing

* Crowdfunding
* Kickstarter
* IndieGoGo
* BlockChain

### 5.4 Actions
* One project we could make with crowdsourcing is a collection of birthdays. If everybody input their name and birthday, we could create aprogram that automatically tells everyone happy birthday on the day. We could also create graphs and data of most common birthdays, zodiac signs and stuff like that.
* I think there are ways we could use crowdsourcing to improve out final website. For example, I think if we allowed people to edit and add to the calendar that we plan on putting in the website, that would be a good way to add info and dates that otehrs may want to see. Our project itself could be based on crowdsourced solutions to the tutorials as well so that others may look at previous solutions that coders have created before them for ideas and guidance on how to complete the tutorials themselves if they are having trouble.

## 5.3 Notes 
* Computer Bias
* Social Media: Facebook vs Tik Tok

### 5.3 Actions 
* Obviosuly, HP computers aren’t racist. Objects like computers can’t be racist, if anything the people who coded them mey have been, but it’s more liekly that there is some mistake or problem that they did not see during testing. Perhaps they only tested facial recognition on certain peoples and that is why there is trouble identifying black people. It seems like a silly mistake that was made with no ill intent or harm meant behind it. It was simply a bug that was not found before release. It still should be fixed, and it is on the coders for not having a diverse enough testing group to find this problem, but it’s very likely if my group were doing this same project, we would have overlooked these same problems. In order to produce a better outcome, the managers should’ve created a more diverse group of coders or testers so that the mistake would have been caught before reaching the public.
