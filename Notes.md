# Tech Talk 5 Notes

## 5.1 Notes: 

* UAVs/Drones
* Dopamine: hormone released when doing something that give you pleasure
* Automated telephone trees
* * Uses a Procedural Structure


## 5.2 Notes:
> To do: code in python, in terminal, can use in PBL later on 

*Digital Divide: denied access to technology
* * Ex: Restrictions within school wifi

### Looking at python menu: 1st example
* Hard coded the values into the print statements 
* Not efficient 
* Try exception: structure that will use to handle errors

### Looking at python menu: 2nd example: Same program more efficient 
* Nested four loops
* Nested lists

> Menu Challenge
1. Build your own menu and sub-menu
2. Add swap and keypad from Tri 2 Week 10, to your project and menu.
3. For additional challenge and review, build a Christmas tree with *s or a pattern of your choice

4. Add two items below to get ready for animations and interacting with terminal codes

### 5.1 Actions
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:
* The World Wide Web: has massively evolved, enabled people to communicate across the word almost instantaneously, share thoughts online, and spread news and information. 
* Multitasking and High Speed: Computers have enabled people to be more productive and efficient by allowing people to multitask at ease
* People and companies van track you or even hack you; invasion of security/privacy. Also the spread of misinformation. 

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? 
* I believe that the effects of dopamine are very real which is why we must be careful with what.whom we surround ourselves with. If we find pleasure in the wrong aspects of life, it can take away from what we already have, while also leading us down paths that may not be safe nor healthy. I think that one example in my personal life is social media and streaming platforms such as Netflix. I find pleasure doing these leisurely activities but they can also prevent me from being productive; especially in school which does not bring me as much pleasure. I think that by limiting the amount of time that I spend on social media and watching videos/shows, I will be able to find more joy in the simpler things in life. 

### 5.2 Actions
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
* One can empower themselves in the digital world by utilizing the resources that are available online. The internet allows users to have access to massive amount of information which is available to use and learn from. 
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
* A way to help empower others is to teach. Take the info you’ve learned online and through the web to help others learn, especially if they don’t have access to those same resources you have. Even at Del Norte we can help empower others through teaching them how to better utilize and use their technology to its fullest capabilities.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
* I think red tape does block digital empowerment often. Here at Del Norte we are pretty well off, the only red tape blocking us is the internet which sometimes blocks sites we could use for learning more about coding. For the most part it isn’t that bad though. However in other places, there are likely lots of things preventing digital empowerment. All policies have to go through bureaucracy and so it may take time before other people are able to digitally empower themselves due to restrictions and blocks placed in front of them.
