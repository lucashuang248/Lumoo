### About Me

Hi, welcome to my Github Repository! My name is Lucas Huang, I am 17, and am a junior here at Del Norte Highschool. I am apart of Del Norte's NHS, Trail Note, Hack Club, and Team TLDEW (APCSP). I love to play basketball and video games, and spend time hanging out with my friends and family.
